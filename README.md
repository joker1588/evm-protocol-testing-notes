# EVM Protocol Testing Notes

This repository contains **Foundry-based Solidity testing examples** and **protocol logic validation notes** for common EVM-based DeFi patterns.

All materials here are derived from **genericized, permission-safe testing scenarios** and are intended for **educational, auditing, and validation purposes only**.

---

## Scope

The focus of this repository is on:

- Smart contract **unit testing**
- Protocol **logic verification**
- Edge case and failure-path analysis
- Reproducible testing patterns using **Foundry**

The examples are intentionally **abstracted and anonymized** to avoid referencing any specific production system.

---

## What You’ll Find

- Generic lending / vault / staking logic test cases  
- Boundary condition and invariant-style checks  
- Common Solidity pitfalls expressed as test scenarios  
- Foundry test patterns for fast iteration and coverage  

Each test is designed to be:
- Deterministic
- Minimal
- Easy to reason about

---

## Tooling

- **Solidity**
- **Foundry (forge / cast)**
- EVM-compatible environments
